# Week1-assignment

I managed to implement the flexbox model including padding.
There is an image set to the background of the webpage.
There is also a navigation bar that is in a fixed position and utilises the row flex direction, it also stays at the top of the screen as you scroll down the page.
The splash page has multiple sections (feature, mid, bottom) and 3 different background images which appear in order as you scroll down the page.

I did struggle with getting the text in the navigation bar at the top to all stay in line and not break out of their border.
I also struggled with getting multiple images set to the background of the webpage.
I solved the above problems by using google and reverse engineering the demo webpage.
I also solved some alignment issues by opening the console for the page and adjusted the in console graph for border and padding etc (The computed tab after selecting an element).
